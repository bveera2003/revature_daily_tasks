        p.name AS product_name,
        SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) AS max_revenue,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY cat.category_id ORDER BY SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) DESC) AS rnk
    FROM order_items oi
    JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
    JOIN categories cat ON p.category_id = cat.category_id
    GROUP BY cat.category_name, cat.category_id, p.name
